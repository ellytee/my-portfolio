            <h3>Project 1: Car Price Prediction</h3>
            <p>
                This school project, completed during my first semester of my master's program, focused on analyzing the Germany used car dataset obtained from Kaggle. 
                My partner and I began by cleaning the data to remove outliers and address any missing information that could potentially impact our model.

                Following the data cleaning phase, we delved into exploring the dataset to identify trends and formulate business-related questions. 
                Our analysis sought to uncover insights such as the top-selling cars, the preferred fuel types among consumers, and other relevant patterns.

                After successfully addressing these questions, we proceeded to build a predictive model. Utilizing the Random Forest Regression model with optimized hyperparameters, we aimed to generate accurate predictions.
                For additional details and comprehensive results, you can refer to the report paper we composed and the Jupyter Notebook links provided below.
